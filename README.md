# the-office-visualisation

This project is a visual exploration of all the dialog in the TV show ‘The Office’. Utilising NLP techniques and other forms of linguistic analysis (such as the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Readability Test), I created a series of visualisations using the D3.js library to explore the data in depth. 

The [dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18wS5AAwOh8QO95RwHLS95POmSNKA2jjzdt0phrxeAE0/edit#gid=747974534) comes courtesy of /umisunderstoodpoetry from reddit.com/r/datasets. All of the data preprocessing was done using Python, and done using Jupyter Notebooks. Libraries used for visualisation were D3.js and chroma.js (for colour scales).
