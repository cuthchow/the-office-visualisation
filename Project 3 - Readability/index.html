            Who is the Smartest Person in The Office?
        </h1>
        <p>
            Ever wondered who the smartest character on "The Office" is? Oscar Martinez was once widely regarded as the smartest
            person in the office, that is, until his position was 'uslurped' by none other than Michael Scott. Michael Scott had bested Oscar
            by demonstrating his wide ranging knowledge of current affairs and the rising urbanisation in China.
            <br><br>
            Despite the heated debate which followed between the two great minds, the title of 'smartest in the office' remains up for grabs.
            I decided to settle this debate once and for all, by conducting a lexical analysis of all the times the characters spoke on camera,
            and assessing the intellectual level of their speech, using the Flesch-Kincaid grade level test. The test roughly equates the complexity
            of their speech to a 'grade-level', and will give use a rough guide as to who speaks with the greatest intellect.

            Based on this analysis, it seems that David Wallace is in fact the smartest character on The Office. This is not surprising, considering
            after all that this is the man who founded 'Suck It', and led Dunder Mifflin to some of their most profitable quarters
            <br><br>
            Unfortunately, it seems that Darryl is at the very bottom of this list. I found this quite surprising considering that this is the man
            who brought to us phrases such as 'Dinkin' flicka' and 'going mach five', not to mention the inspiration inducing 'pippity poppity, give me the zoppity'.
            <br><br>
            At least one thing is for sure: Michael is DEFINITELY smarter than Oscar. Suck it Oscar.
